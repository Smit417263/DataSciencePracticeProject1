# Data Science Practice Project 1: Height Distribution Analysis

## About This Project

This is part of my journey exploring data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I'm building a collection of mini projects to strengthen my skills with the essential tools and techniques used in data analysis and ML/AI development.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the height distribution of U.S. Presidents using Python data science libraries. The analysis includes:

- Loading and processing CSV data with Pandas
- Statistical analysis with NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing and statistics
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smit417263/DataSciencePracticeProject1.git
cd DataSciencePracticeProject1
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the analysis:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will display a histogram showing the height distribution of U.S. Presidents.

## Dataset

The project uses `heights.csv`, which contains height data (in centimeters) of U.S. Presidents.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I'm gaining hands-on experience with:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis
- Creating effective data visualizations
- Python virtual environments and dependency management
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Future Improvements

- Add more statistical analysis (correlation, hypothesis testing)
- Compare heights across different time periods
- Explore relationships between height and other presidential attributes
- Create more advanced visualizations
